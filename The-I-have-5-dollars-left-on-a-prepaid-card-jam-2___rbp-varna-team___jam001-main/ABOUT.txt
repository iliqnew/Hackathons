27.11.2020 - 29.11.2020 GameDev Jam

Me and my former coleagues from Robopartans Varna took part in a nice litle GameDev Jam.
The topic was "Roll"

We splitted into two teams.
The content here is the product of our 2nd team's work and imagination.
Our idea was to make a rolling mage game.
The mage has several abilities and tries to find all kinds of enemies.
After every level the mage completes, there is a dice roll.
The result of the dice then enhances your abilities.
